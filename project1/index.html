        While deforestation cannot be avoided completely,
         we must look to control it. Young and immature trees
          should not be felled as far as possible. We must look to avoid large-scale commercial deforestation as well. 
        Adapting practices such as clear-cutting or selective cutting
         will be beneficial in the long run..

      <p>
        Forest fires are the most common and deadly cause
         of loss of forests. They can start due to natural causes 
         or can be accidents caused by man or even intentional in some cases. Once a fire spreads in a forest it is very difficult to control.
         Precautions must be taken for such incidents.
          Making fire lanes, spreading chemicals to control fire, clearing out dry leaves and trees etc.

        This is the process by which we plant more trees in the area.
         We try to increase the forest cover by manual
         transplantation, or fresh plantation of trees. It is
          an attempt to balance our ecosystem to reduce the effects 
          of deforestation and environmental pollutions of all types.
